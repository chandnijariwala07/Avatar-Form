# Avatar-Form

Here I have developed the application where "AVATAR FORM" is created.
In which you can select your Avatar and can apply all other accessories provided in the options with Preview. 
The whole application is developed in React with another library called "avataaars".

## Requirements:
ReactJS, npm

## Installation:
Go to the Campai-task Directory.
*	Install the application: ‘run npm install’
*	Start the application server: ‘npm start’
*	View in browser at 'http://localhost:3000'

## Note:
This is only the frontend part of this application
